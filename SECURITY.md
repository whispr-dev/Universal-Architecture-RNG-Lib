## Reporting a Vulnerability

warning - v1. had absolutely squat thought put into security in nay way whats-o-ever!
although 1.6 had some thought in that zone it wasn't in any way particularly implemented.
finally here in 1.7 we actuallyhave some ocde with a degree of decent level of thught
towards the fact that this fundamentally is very likely to attract interest and use in 
cryptographic circles and so might actually merit some consideration of how errors
effect outcomes, use and access etc. this has been actually not just considered but 
brought into code design nwith efforts to avoid NaNs being poure out amongst other things.
